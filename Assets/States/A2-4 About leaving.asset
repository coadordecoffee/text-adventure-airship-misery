  storyText: '"You sure about leaving?" he firmly asked. "I don''t know, feels like
    you should first remember where you were going to begin with. At least, where
    you came from!" He sighs.


    "Well, I''d recommend checking your flight information
    at the main office. We are short on staff though, and I could really get an extra
    pair of hands in the night shift. I don''t attend many people during the day,
    but at night it''s difficult the amount of people that will be among us. Maybe
    that helps you recover your memory before rushing to the world out there."


    What
    should you do?

    1. Thank him and leave for the main office.

    2. Offer
    him help.'
