  storyText: "\"Here you are mate\". He hands you a freezing glass of bier. You appreciate
    it with moderation, in fear of going into another memory loss coma. \r\n\r\n\"How
    big is this ship?\" you ask.\r\n\r\n\"How big?\" he quickly responds. \"Let's
    just say big enough to store meals and fuel for years for dozens of hundreds
    of people. This is almost like a city you know. People drop in and out, some
    never go out. We workers of the ship have a free food, a home for our families
    on board and money to spend on our needs.\"\r\n\r\nWhat should you do?\r\n1.
    Ask him for a stout pint and what this ship is for.\r\n2. Ask him when you may
    leave."
