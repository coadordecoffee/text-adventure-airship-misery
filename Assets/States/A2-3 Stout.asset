  storyText: "\"Here you are mate\". He hands you a freezing glass of stout. You
    appreciate it with moderation, in fear of going into another memory loss coma.
    The aroma is delightful.\r \"So what the hell is this for?\" you ask.\r\n\r\n\"Is
    your head ok?\" he wonders. \"This is an international constant-flight airship.
    How did you even get here without knowing?\"\r\r \"Well, this airship is for
    lengthy flights. Simple as that. It's definitely slower than most other flights,
    but here, you have the luxury of doing other stuff while traveling. It's used
    mostly for governmental issues and meetings across the planet, but some people
    are here just for fun or to work, like myself. It is quite better and cooler
    than where I used to live. Hot and disgusting hell, that fucking country.\" \r\r\n\r\nWhat
    should you do?\r\n1. Ask him for a weiss bier and how big is the ship.\r\n2.
    Ask him when you may leave."
