  storyText: "It is dusk. You wake up from a bustling nightmare. You can hear the
    crackling and creaking from the airship. \"Airship..?\" You think to yourself.
    \rYou find youself sitting at a short, round table with nothing but your bag,
    an emptied cup of coffee, and a plant vase. You remember nothing.\r You look
    around and see yourself in a weird corridor, with many other tables like the
    one you are sitting at, and, in the far end of the corridor,\r an elegant bar
    with a single person behind it, cleaning a glass cup with a cloth. To the wall
    on your left, many hatch windows are displayed, with the\r vibrant orange light
    coming from behind the clouds. You feel peaceful, yet restless. \r\n\r\nWhat
    should you do?\r\n\r\n1. Ask the bartender about the airship.\r\n\r\n"
