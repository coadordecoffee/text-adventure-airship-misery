  storyText: 'Since you didn''t know anything about your past, you decided to stay
    at the bar working to make some money and try remembering about your past. With
    time you remembered your house was tragically destroyed by a fire and your parents
    were killed. You broke down in front of a customer that asked the bartender a
    drink for you. You later discovered he was an international detective from Japan.
    He told you to never give up on this world. With time, you decided to stay permanently
    on the ship, helping lost souls just like the bartender and the detective did
    to you. You even met a beautiful and strong woman the same age as you. When you
    got to know her, she told you she was the detective''s daughter. After many days
    of conversation at the bar, the both of you decided to stay together and have
    many babies.
