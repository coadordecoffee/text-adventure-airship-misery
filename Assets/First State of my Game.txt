It is dusk. You wake up from a bustling nightmare. You can hear the crackling and creaking from the airship. "Airship..?" You think to yourself. 
You find youself sitting at a short, round table with nothing but your bag, an emptied cup of coffee, and a plant vase. You remember nothing.
You look around and see yourself in a weird corridor, with many other tables like the one you are sitting at, and, in the far end of the corridor,
an elegant bar with a single person behind it, cleaning a glass cup with a cloth. To the wall on your left, many hatch windows are displayed, with the
vibrant orange light coming from behind the clouds. You feel peaceful, yet restless. 

What should you do?

1. Ask the bartender about the airship.
2. Look for an exit.
